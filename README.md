## Description

_This page was built so you could put in a whole number and at the click of "Show Result!" a sophisticated result should appear. Using JavaScript Arrays and Loops through methods and functions. Once clicked, the result should include every number before your number (starting from "1"). This is unless the number contains a 1, 2, or 3. If the number has a 1 in it and doesn't include a 2 or 3, replace the number with "Beep!". If the number has a 2 in it and doesn't include a 3, replace the number with "Boop!". If the number has a 3 in it, replace the number with "Won't you be my neighbor?". If your result follows that criteria then it's doing it's job. Give it a try by acquiring the Installation Requirements and following the Setup instructions below_

## Installation Requirements
- Requires Visual Studio Code Installation
- Requires Terminal Installation
- Requires "Live Server" Extension in VSCode
- Requires Google Chrome

## Setup
- Click Code at the top right of the repository
- Copy that url
- Make a new directory in Terminal by typing "mkdir view-a-and-r"
- Change into that directory by entering "cd view-a-and-r "
- Clone the url into that directory using "git clone (paste url from repository)"
- Change into that cloned directory by entering "cd view-a-and-r"
- Type code . in terminal to open in VSCode
- Once in VSCode under make sure the explorer tap on the top left hand side of the window is selected
- Under "ARRAYS-AND-LOOPING" left click on index.html file
- Right click in the index HTML script
- Select "Open with Live Server" option
- This will open a Google Chrome Browser
- There you can see my webpage
