## Description

_This page was built so you could put in a whole number and at the click of "Show Result!" a sophisticated result should appear. Using JavaScript Arrays and Loops through methods and functions. Once clicked, the result should include every number before your number (starting from "1"). This is unless the number contains a 1, 2, or 3. If the number has a 1 in it and doesn't include a 2 or 3, replace the number with "Beep!". If the number has a 2 in it and doesn't include a 3, replace the number with "Boop!". If the number has a 3 in it, replace the number with "Won't you be my neighbor?". If your result follows that criteria then it's doing it's job.
